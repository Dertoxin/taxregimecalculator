                Computing income tax is a complex computation with never ending
                complexity caused by multiple sections, deductions and
                exemptions defined under the income tax act. To add to your
                misery, Government has introduced a new tax regime. We have
                noticed even CA outsource their tax compution to other CA's
                which shows how complex is this exercise of computation. This
                website provides you a simple one-stop answer to compute your
                income tax payable without having to read and understand the
                various expemtions/sections/deductions defined under the income
                tax act.
